# C-CPlusplus
This repository contains quick snippets to know the core concepts in c and c++. 
Sometimes during the development process, one need to quickly review a concept.
As i was revisiting the core concepts of c and c++, i created these examples so that anyone including me
can quickly review a concept when needed and would save time going through internet.
